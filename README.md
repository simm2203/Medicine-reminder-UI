# Medicine-reminder-UI
The aim of this project was to add a feature in an existing health-tech app, that provides online consultations to patients, medicines, surgical services etc. 
I've curated this user interface using figma.
The feature solves the problem of patients forgetting to take their medicines or adherence to their medications. 
Here, patients have an option to just download the app, feed in a few details about their medicine, the time of their dose intake and then set the reminder, as per their requirement. The way this feature works is that it simply gives the consumer a reminder in the form of a push notification so that they don't fail to take their medicine on time.
